    #
    # - slices
    # - multi-storage consumer
    # - consumer group (?)
    # - topic cli arg
    # - interaction between BROKER_CONFIG + KAFKA_TOPIC_MAP +
    # KAFKA_BROKER_CONFIG had to be reimplemented. But does it match the Python
    # impl?
    #
    # ideally the config passed to rust would contain physical topic name, the
    # right kafka broker config and clickhouse cluster to use, and nothing
    # else.
    #
    # there is an argument for keeping it as-is, and that is if we need to read
    # the storage yaml at compile-time, to do code generation. It might be
    # necessary if we want to define import paths for Rust message processors
    # in yaml, e.g.:
    #
    # stream_loader:
    #   processor:
    #     python_name: snuba.processors.QuerylogProcessor
