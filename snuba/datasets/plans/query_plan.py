    Provides the directions to execute a Clickhouse Query against one
    storage or multiple joined ones.

    This is produced by a QueryPlanner class (provided either by the
    dataset or by an entity) after the dataset query processing has
    been performed and the storage/s has/have been selected.

    It embeds the Clickhouse Query (the query to run on the storage
    after translation). It also provides a plan execution strategy
    that takes care of coordinating the execution of the query against
    the database. The execution strategy can also decide to split the
    query into multiple chunks.

    When running a query we need a cluster, the cluster is picked according
    to the storages sets containing the storages used in the query.
    So the plan keeps track of the storage set as well.
    There must be only one storage set per query.

    TODO: Bring the methods that apply the processors in the plan itself.
    Now that we have two Plan implementations with a different
    structure, all code depending on this would have to be written
    differently depending on the implementation.
    Having the methods inside the plan would make this simpler.
