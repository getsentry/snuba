class RecoveryState:
    """
    When the stateful consumer starts, it consumes the entire content of the control
    topic. This is supposed to tell the consumer what to do next.
    There are a few possible states the control topic can be into:
    - empty: do nothing and start consuming the main topic
    - messages related to a snapshot that this consumer does not care for: ignore
      and commit them.
    - a snapshot-init message the consumer is interested into is the last message of interest
      on the topic.
      In this case the consumer is supposed to pause till there is a snapshot-loaded message
      or a snapshot-abort message. This message should not be committed until the snapshot
      has been loaded and the consumer has caught up.
    - a snapshot-loaded message (related with a snapshot-init) message is on the topic.
      This means a snapshot has been successfully uploaded and the consumer needs to interpret
      the transaction data, catch up, and then start consuming normally.

    This class implements all the logic above by consuming all the messages present
    on the control topic, keeping track of the snapshot we expect to be the one the consumer
    is interested into and producing the ConsumerStateCompletionEvent the state should
    return.

    Corner cases:
    - Overlapping snapshots: which means two subsequent snapshot-init messages. In this
      case the first one wins. No other init message will be taken into account until we
      do not observe a completion message for the current snapshot (abort or loaded).
    - Multiple completed snapshots present on the control topic in sequence. Here the last one wins
      and the previous ones are ignored so we do not need to know whether the previous ones
      were succesfully uploaded or not.

    test_recovery_state shows some examples.
