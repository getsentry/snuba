class MultipleConcurrentPipeline(QueryExecutionPipeline):
    """
    A query pipeline that executes a request against one or more other pipelines
    in parallel.

    It can be used as a way to switch between different pipelines depending on the
    query received and the selector function provided. It can also be used to run
    a single query against multiple pipelines, and their associated query plans
    and storages in order to test and compare the results and performance of
    various pipelines before rolling them out to users.

    The pipelines that are built and executed on a particular query are determined
    by the selector function which returns a sequence of query builder IDs. The
    first item in the list corresponds to the pipeline that will be used to ultimately
    return a result. Hence the selector function must return a list with at least
    one value in it.

    Subsequent (if any) pipelines that are also returned by the selector function
    will be executed in separate threads. The results of these other queries are
    provided to the callback function if one is provided.

    This component is produced by the PipelineDelegator.
