    This class represents a single stage in the snuba query execution pipeline.
    The purpose of this class is to provide an organized and transparent interface to
    execute specific processing steps on the query with clearly defined inputs and outputs.
    These stages are designed to be composed and/or swapped among each other to form a
    a flexible query pipeline.

    Some examples of a query pipeline stage may include:
    * Execute all entity query processors defined on the entity yaml
    * Apply query transformation from logical representation to Clickhouse representation
    * Execute all storage processors defined on the storage yaml
    * Run query execution
    * Query reporting

    To create a Query Pipeline Stage, the main components to specify are:
    an input type, an output type, and a execution function which returns the output wrapped with QueryPipelineResult.
