    An abstract class that provides methods to consume messages from a

    instance.

    Backends that implement this abstract interface may or may not be thread
    safe. (If in doubt, better to assume that they are not thread safe.)

    All methods are blocking unless otherise noted in the documentation for

        Return the next message available to be consumed, if one is
        available. If no message is available, this method will block up to
        the ``timeout`` value before returning ``None``. A timeout of
        ``0.0`` represents "do not block", while a timeout of ``None``
        represents "block until a message is available (or forever)".

        Calling this method may also invoke subscription state change
        callbacks.

        This method may raise ``ConsumerError`` or one of it's
        subclasses, the specific meaning of which are backend implementation
        specific.

        This method may also raise an ``EndOfStream`` error (a subtype of
        ``ConsumerError``) when the consumer has reached the end of a stream
        that it is subscribed to and no additional messages are available.
        The ``stream`` attribute of the raised exception specifies the end
        which stream has been reached. (Since this consumer is multiplexing a
        set of streams, this exception does not mean that *all* of the
        streams that the consumer is subscribed to do not have any messages,
        just that it has reached the end of one of them. This also does not
        mean that additional messages won't be available in future poll
        calls.) Not every backend implementation supports this feature or is
        configured to raise in this scenario.
