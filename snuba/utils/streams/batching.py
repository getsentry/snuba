    * Messages are processed locally (e.g. not written to an external datastore!) as they are
      read from the consumer, then added to an in-memory batch
    * Batches are flushed based on the batch size or time sent since the first message
      in the batch was recieved (e.g. "500 items or 1000ms")
    * Consumer offsets are not automatically committed! If they were, offsets might be committed
      for messages that are still sitting in an in-memory batch, or they might *not* be committed
      when messages are sent to an external datastore right before the consumer process dies
    * Instead, when a batch of items is flushed they are written to the external datastore and
      then consumer offsets are immediately committed (in the same thread/loop)
    * Users need only provide an implementation of what it means to process a raw message
      and flush a batch of events

    NOTE: This does not eliminate the possibility of duplicates if the consumer process
    crashes between writing to its backend and commiting offsets. This should eliminate
    the possibility of *losing* data though. An "exactly once" consumer would need to store
    offsets in the external datastore and reconcile them on any partition rebalance.
