# via the ``Consumer``), but this type should provide a means for the consumer
# to uniquely identify a stream. For example, if the stream backend is a file,
# this type should be the filename -- not the file object or file descriptor.
# If the stream is a Kafka partition, this should be the topic name and
# partition ID.

# be the partition offset. Offset types should have a total ordering.

# The ``TValue`` is the type of data represented by the messages in this

# for this type to have more structure: a dataclass or some other object
# representation (after deserialization of the raw bytes) is generally more
# appropriate.
