        Implements a read-through caching pattern for the value at the given
        key. This method first attempts to fetch and return a preexisting
        value from the cache. On a cache miss, the return value of the
        provided function is used to populate the cache for subsequent
        callers and is used as the return value for this method.

        This function also acts as an exclusive lock on the cache key to
        other callers of this method while the function is executing. Callers
        will be blocked until the client that holds the lock (the first
        client to get a cache miss) has completed executing the function and
        placed its result in cache.

        If the client holding the lock does not successfully execute the
        function, no result value will be populated. The client that held the
        lock will raise the original exception, and all other clients will raise
        an ``ExecutionError`` when unblocked.

        If the client holding the lock does not finish executing the function
        prior to the timeout being reached, the client that held the lock
        will raise a ``TimeoutError`` and will not populate the cache with
        the value upon function completetion to avoid potentially overwriting
        a fresher value with a stale value. Meanwhile, all blocked clients
        will raise a ``ExecutionTimeoutError`` when the timeout elapses.
        Since the timeout clock starts when the first client takes the
        execution lock and begins to execute the function, the timeout is an
        upper bound on the actual amount of time that any subsequent clients
        will be blocked -- they will likely get a result or throw a
        ``ExecutionTimeoutError`` in a time window substantially shorter than
        the full timeout duration.
