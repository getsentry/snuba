    A transformation applied to a Query. This depends on the query structure and

    This transformation mutates the Query object in place.

    These processors tweak the query and are developed independently from each other,
    thus they have to be fully independent.
    When developing a processor for a dataset, it would be a bad idea to implicitly
    depend on the result of a previous one. Each processor should always check its
    own preconditions instead.

    Processors are designed to be stateless. There is no guarantee whether the same
