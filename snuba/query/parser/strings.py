    """
    Parses a string expression found in a Snuba Query into an AST
    expression. This is supposed to work for any non structured expression
    in the Snuba Query.

    This guarantees that string expressions that correspond to columns
    the user expect to see in the response (columns, literals, and tags[]
    expressions) have an alias in the AST. This alias corresponds to the
    string the user put into the query (which is the name of the column they
    will find in the result).
    This is done so that the column name provided by the user is preserved
    across the query processing pipeline and it is applied to the Clickhouse
    query as alias.

    As a consequence, the only requirement, when translating or transforming
    an expression is to preserve the alias of the input expression regardless
    to how it was generated, and by whom.
