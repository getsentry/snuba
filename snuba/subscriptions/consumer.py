    The ``TickConsumer`` is a ``Consumer`` implementation that differs from
    other ``Consumer`` implementations in that the messages returned returns
    contain a ``Tick`` that is derived from the timestamps of the previous
    two messages received within a partition.

    In other words, this consumer provides a measure of the progression of
    time, using the advancement of the broker timestamp within a Kafka
    partition as a "virtual clock" rather than depending on wall clock time.

    This consumer requires that the ``message.timestamp.type`` topic
    configuration is set to ``LogAppendTime`` for the topics that it is
    subscribed to, so that that the message time is set by the primary broker
    for the topic -- not the producer of the message -- ensuring that each
    partition timestamp moves monotonically.
    """

    # Since this consumer deals with the intervals *between* messages rather
    # the individual messages themselves, this introduces some additional
    # complexity into the way that offsets are managed. Take this example,
    # where a partition contains three messages:
    #
    #    Message:            A         B         C         D
    #    Offset:             0         1         2         3
    #    Timeline:   --------+---------+---------+---------+------>>>
    #
    # Consuming message "A" (via a call to ``poll``) does not cause a tick to
    # be returned, since an tick interval cannot be formed with the timestamp
    # from only one message. When message B is consumed, we can form a tick
    # interval using the timestamps from A and B.
    #
    # When storing (or committing) offsets, we need to be careful that we
    # correctly commit the offsets that represent the interval so that
    # intervals are not repeated or skipped when a consumer restarts (or more
    # likely rebalances, which can be generalized to a restart operation.)
    #
    # Take the previously described scenario where we had just returned a tick
    # interval that was represented by the mesasges A and B: without taking any
    # precautions, the Kafka consumer would use the next offset from message B
    # for commit, which would be 2 in this case (1 + 1). If the consumer were
    # to crash and restart, it would resume at offset 2, causing the next tick
    # interval returned to be for the messages C and D -- in this case, B and C
    # was never returned! To avoid skipping intervals when restarting, the
    # consumer would have had to commit the offset 1 (the offset of message B)
    # to ensure that upon restart, the next interval would be the interval
    # between B and C, since the message B was the first message received by
    # the consumer.
