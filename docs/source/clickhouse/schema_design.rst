ClickHouse Schema Design Best Practices
=======================================

Columns based on dictionary data
--------------------------------

ClickHouse is a columnar datastore, and at run-time it loads columns on-demand
based on the columns referenced in the query (both the columns ``SELECT`` ed
and those part of the ``WHERE`` clause). The ability to store different columns independently
and not load them for every row for every query is part of the performance advantage that
ClickHouse provides over a traditional RDBMS (like PostgreSQL).

Commonly, a data schema contains a flexible key:value pair mapping
(canonically: ``tags`` or ``contexts``) and stores that
data in a column that contains two ``Nested`` arrays where the first array contains the keys
of the dictionary and the second array contains the values. This works well when
your dataset design gives you the ability to filter based on other attributes to a small
number of rows and the flexibility of completely arbitrary keys and values are a real requirement.
Often, however, a ClickHouse user is interested in rows that contain a specific tag key or a
specific ``key=value`` pair. In this case one is often best-served by creating a top-level
column and "promoting" the data to it [#dupe]_.

This promotion is preferable on a couple dimensions:

1. Even though it looks like a dictionary, our tags and contexts "maps" are actually arrays of keys and values.
   With array accesses Clickhouse needs to locate the index of the key whose value needs to be looked up.
   That is an O(N) lookup. The same key may be located at different indexes for each row.
   Once the index is known, looking up its value is O(1) since you perform direct index access.
   If the query has to lookup M rows, this becomes an O(M * N) in terms of time complexity.

   With direct column access, there is no index lookup for a key. The overall complexity to lookup M rows
   for "promoted columns" is O(M).
2. Queries that filter based on an array column may have to load the entire column into memory
   in order to do filtering. Adding a new index on top of a top-level column is a more
   straightforward operation that guarantees more consistent performance outcomes vs. iterating
   over an array

.. [#dupe] During migration from non-promoted to promoted, putting the data in both map and
           top-level column may be necessary so that queries of old rows can still access the
           attributes. After the table goes through a full TTL period and the API/storage definition
           is changed to serve the values from the top-level field, message processors should be changed
           to stop writing the data in duplicate places.

   done indexes on arrays, and when that might be appropriate)
