/// This abstract class provides an interface for consuming messages from a
/// multiplexed collection of partitioned topic streams.
///
/// Partitions support sequential access, as well as random access by
/// offsets. There are three types of offsets that a consumer interacts with:
/// working offsets, staged offsets, and committed offsets. Offsets always
/// represent the starting offset of the *next* message to be read. (For
/// example, committing an offset of X means the next message fetched via
/// poll will have a least an offset of X, and the last message read had an
/// offset less than X.)
///
/// The working offsets are used track the current read position within a
/// partition. This can be also be considered as a cursor, or as high
/// watermark. Working offsets are local to the consumer process. They are
/// not shared with other consumer instances in the same consumer group and
/// do not persist beyond the lifecycle of the consumer instance, unless they
/// are committed.
///
/// Committed offsets are managed by an external arbiter/service, and are
/// used as the starting point for a consumer when it is assigned a partition
/// during the subscription process. To ensure that a consumer roughly "picks
/// up where it left off" after restarting, or that another consumer in the
/// same group doesn't read messages that have been processed by another
/// consumer within the same group during a rebalance operation, positions must
/// be regularly committed by calling ``commit_offsets`` after they have been
/// staged with ``stage_offsets``. Offsets are not staged or committed
/// automatically!
///
/// During rebalance operations, working offsets are rolled back to the
/// latest committed offset for a partition, and staged offsets are cleared
/// after the revocation callback provided to ``subscribe`` is called. (This
/// occurs even if the consumer retains ownership of the partition across
/// assignments.) For this reason, it is generally good practice to ensure
/// offsets are committed as part of the revocation callback.
