<h1>Snuba Query Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#snuba-query-processing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Snuba has a query processing pipeline that starts with the parsing of the
Snuba query language (legacy and SnQL) into an AST ands with a SQL query
being executed on Clickhouse. Between these two phases, several passes on
the AST to apply query processing transformations are executed.</p>
<p>The processing pipeline has two main goals: optimize the query and prevent
queries that would be dangerous for our infrastructure.</p>
<p>As for the data model, the query processing pipeline is divided into a logical
section where the product related processing is performed and a physical
section which is focused on optimizing the query.</p>
<p>The logical sections contains steps like the validation of the query to
ensure it matches the data model or applying custom functions. The physical
section includes steps like promoting tags and selecting a pre-aggregated
view to serve the query.</p>
<section id="query-processing-phases">
<h2>Query Processing Phases<a class="headerlink" href="#query-processing-phases" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section gives an introduction and some pointers to code and examples
for the phases discussed above.</p>
<img alt="../_images/queryprocessing.png" src="../_images/queryprocessing.png" />
<section id="legacy-and-snql-parsers">
<h3>Legacy and SnQL Parsers<a class="headerlink" href="#legacy-and-snql-parsers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Snuba supports two languages, the legacy JSON based one and the new one named
SnQL. With the exceptions of joins and composite queries which are not supported
by the legacy language, the query processing pipeline does not change whether
one or the other language is used.</p>
<p>They both produce a logical query AST which is represented by
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/tree/master/snuba/query">this data structure</a>.</p>
<p>The legacy parser is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/query/parser/__init__.py">here</a>,
while the SnQL parser is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/tree/master/snuba/query/snql">in this module</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="query-validation">
<h3>Query Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#query-validation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This phase ensures the query can be run (most of the times, we do not yet catch
all possible invalid queries). The responsibility of this phase is to return an
HTTP400 in case of an invalid query with a proper useful message to the user.</p>
<p>This is divided in two sub-phases: general validation and entity specific
validation.</p>
<p>General validation is composed by a set of checks that are applied to each query
right after the Query is produced by the parser. This happens
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/query/parser/__init__.py#L91">in this function</a>.
This includes validations like preventing alias shadowing and function signature
validation.</p>
<p>Each entity can provide some validation logic as well in the form of required
columns. This happens <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/datasets/entity.py#L46-L47">in this class</a>.
This allows the query processing to reject queries that do not have a condition
on project_id or that do not have a time range.</p>
</section>
<section id="logical-query-processors">
<h3>Logical Query Processors<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-query-processors" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Query processors are stateless transformations that receive a Query object (with
its AST) and transform it in place. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/query/processors/__init__.py">This</a>
is the interface to implement for logical processors. In the logical phase each
entity provides the query processors to be applied in sequence.  Common use
cases are custom functions like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/10b747da57d7d833374984d5eb31151393577911/snuba/query/processors/performance_expressions.py#L12-L20">apdex</a>,
or time bucketing like the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/query/processors/timeseries_processor.py">time series processor</a>.</p>
<p>Query processors are not supposed to depend on other processors to be executed
before or after and should be independent from each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="storage-selector">
<h3>Storage Selector<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-selector" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>As explained in <a class="reference internal" href="datamodel.html"><span class="doc">Snuba Data Model</span></a>, each Entity can define multiple Storages.
Multiple storages represent multiple tables and materialized views can be defined
for performance reasons as some can respond to some queries faster.</p>
<p>At the end of the logical processing phase (which is entirely based on the entity)
the storage selector can inspect the query and pick the appropriate storage for
the query. Storage selectors are defined in the entity data model and implement
this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/datasets/storage.py#L155-L165">interface</a>.
An example is the Errors entity, which has two storages, one is for consistent
queries (they are routed to the same nodes where events are written) and the
other only includes replicas we do not write onto to serve most queries. This
reduces the load on the nodes we write onto.</p>
</section>
<section id="query-translator">
<h3>Query Translator<a class="headerlink" href="#query-translator" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Different storages have different schemas (these reflect the schema of a
clickhouse table or view). All of them are generally different from the entity
model, the most notable example being the subscriptable expression used for
tags <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags[abc]</span></code> that does not exist in clickhouse where accessing a tags
looks like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags.values[indexOf(tags.key,</span> <span class="pre">'abc')]</span></code> .</p>
<p>After a storage has been selected, the query needs to be translated to the physical
query. Translator is a rule based systems, rules are defined by the entity (for
each storage) and are applied in sequence.</p>
<p>Contrarily to query processors, translation rules do not have full context
on the query and can only translate an individual expression. This allows us
to compose translation rules easily and reuse them across entities.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/datasets/entities/transactions.py#L33-L81">These</a>
are the translation rules for the transactions entity.</p>
</section>
<section id="physical-query-processors">
<h3>Physical Query Processors<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-query-processors" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Physical query processors work in a very similar way compared to the Logical
query processors. Their interface is very similar and the semantics is the same.
The difference is that they operate on the physical query and, as such, they
are mainly designed for optimizations. For example <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/master/snuba/query/processors/mapping_optimizer.py">this processor</a>
finds equality conditions on tags and replace them with the equivalent condition
on a tags hashmap (where we have a bloom filter index) making the filtering
operation faster.</p>
</section>
<section id="query-formatter">
<h3>Query Formatter<a class="headerlink" href="#query-formatter" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This component simply formats the query into the Clickhouse query string.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="composite-query-processing">
<h2>Composite Query Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#composite-query-processing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The discussion above is valid only for simple queries, composite ones
(joins and queries that include subqueries follow a slightly different path).</p>
<p>The simple query pipeline discussed above would not work on join queries or
on queries that contain subqueries. In order to make that work, each step
would have to take into account joined queries and subqueries, which would
multiply the complexity of the process.</p>
<p>To solve the issue we transform each join query into a join of multiple
simple subqueries. Each subquery is a simple query that can be processed by
the pipeline described above. This is also the preferred way to run Clickhouse
joins as it allows us to apply filters before the join.</p>
<img alt="../_images/compositeprocessing.png" src="../_images/compositeprocessing.png" />
<p>The Query Processing Pipeline for this type of queries is composed of a few
additional steps with respect to what was described above.</p>
<section id="subquery-generator">
<h3>Subquery Generator<a class="headerlink" href="#subquery-generator" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This component takes a simple SnQL join query and create a subquery for each
table in the join.</p>
</section>
<section id="expressions-push-down">
<h3>Expressions Push Down<a class="headerlink" href="#expressions-push-down" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The query generated at the previous step would be a valid join but incredibly
inefficient. This step is basically a join optimizer that pushes down into
subqueries all expressions that can be part of a subquery. This is a needed
step independently from the subquery processing as the Clickhouse join engine
does not do any expression push down and it would be up to Snuba to optimize
the query.</p>
</section>
<section id="simple-query-processing-pipeline">
<h3>Simple Query Processing Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-query-processing-pipeline" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the same pipeline discussed above from the logical query validation
to the physical query processors.</p>
</section>
<section id="join-optimizations">
<h3>Join Optimizations<a class="headerlink" href="#join-optimizations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the end of the processing we can apply some optimizations to the overall
composite query like turning a join into a Semi Join.</p>
