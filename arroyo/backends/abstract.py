class Consumer(Generic[TPayload], ABC):
    """
    This abstract class provides an interface for consuming messages from a
    multiplexed collection of partitioned topic streams.

    Partitions support sequential access, as well as random access by
    offsets. There are three types of offsets that a consumer interacts with:
    working offsets, staged offsets, and committed offsets. Offsets always
    represent the starting offset of the *next* message to be read. (For
    example, committing an offset of X means the next message fetched via
    poll will have a least an offset of X, and the last message read had an
    offset less than X.)

    The working offsets are used track the current read position within a
    partition. This can be also be considered as a cursor, or as high
    watermark. Working offsets are local to the consumer process. They are
    not shared with other consumer instances in the same consumer group and
    do not persist beyond the lifecycle of the consumer instance, unless they
    are committed.

    Committed offsets are managed by an external arbiter/service, and are
    used as the starting point for a consumer when it is assigned a partition
    during the subscription process. To ensure that a consumer roughly "picks
    up where it left off" after restarting, or that another consumer in the
    same group doesn't read messages that have been processed by another
    consumer within the same group during a rebalance operation, offsets must
    be regularly committed by calling ``commit_offsets`` after they have been
    staged with ``stage_offsets``. Offsets are not staged or committed
    automatically!

    During rebalance operations, working offsets are rolled back to the
    latest committed offset for a partition, and staged offsets are cleared
    after the revocation callback provided to ``subscribe`` is called. (This
    occurs even if the consumer retains ownership of the partition across
    assignments.) For this reason, it is generally good practice to ensure
    offsets are committed as part of the revocation callback.

        ownership of the partition. (If this partition was assigned to a
        different consumer in the consumer group during a rebalance, that
        consumer would not have knowledge of whether or not the partition was
        previously paused and would start consuming from the partition.) If
